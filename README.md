# Design-Thinking-MISSA
Currently, there is no industry exposure for the students studying in our school. 
To understand how business process works, students should be given cognizance on corporate work culture and  upcoming market trends. 
Students find difficulty in interacting with the industry experts as there  is no platform for them to communicate with these experts. 
Also, students lack awareness on the latest technologies which will help them for their career growth. 
Keeping this scenario in mind, we have created an association for students so that they can communicate with industry experts to apply their knowledge delivered by these experts into practical application
